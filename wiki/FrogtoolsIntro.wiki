#summary What is here, and what goes where.

= Introduction =

This site is just in the early stages, but it may as well stay organized!

= Details =

  * Each plugin, addon, etc., has its _own_ directory in the trunk
  * All XML update files should go in the svn/xml/ directory

= Housekeeping =

  * It's a good idea to update the changelog.txt files with each commit

I'm sure there will be more! :)
