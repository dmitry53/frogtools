CONTACT FORM for FROG CMS=========================Version: 1.0.3--------------License: MIT--------Original 1.0 version: "You are free to change modify and alter thisplugin in way shape or form, just provide a link back to ajcates.com inthe readme file or source code.You may distribute this plugin freely but never sell it."v. 1.0 Created by AJ Cates (http://ajcates.com/)v. 1.0.1+ maintained by David Reimer (http://erajad.byethost.10.com/)V. 1.0.2+ collaborative code on Frogtools (http://code.google.com/p/frogtools/)USE THE ISSUE TRACKER AT GOOGLE CODE FOR ANY BUG REPORTSAbout:------This simple contact form supplies three fields: name, email, and message.The form is checked to ensure all fields are filled in; if any are missing,the form must be reloaded.As of 1.0.3, an additional field has been added to inhibit spambots.How to setup:-------------1. Unzip (if you're reading this, you have!) and move the contents of the"contact_form" *folder* to your /frog/plugins/ directory.2. Go to the "Administration" > "Plugins" tab in Frog's backend, and tickthe Contact Form box in the "Enabled" column. Click on the "Settings" tab,go to the bottom of the page and click on the "Save" button.3. Create your "contact" page (or using an appropriate current page),insert this code into the "Body" portion:<?php makeForm(yourEmail@yourSite.com); ?>with the email you wish the message to be sent to replacing the "dummy"email address above.(Note that the TinyMCE and Textile filters do *not* like raw PHP! So forthis page, use either the Markdown filter, or none at all.)4. Add the following code to your site's CSS file:.contactForm {	width:308px;}.contactForm p {	padding:10px;}.contactForm input {	width:240px;}.contactForm textarea {	width:281px;	height:120px;}.submit {	width:45px!important;}.hide {	display:none;}5. Done!How to update:--------------Simply replace the old /plugins/contact_form/index.php file with the new one./////////////////////////Change log:------------ added French language file1.0.3 [2009.03.25]- added strings and directory for i18n (now requires 0.9.5)- added "fight comment spam with CSS" test (see http://bit.ly/tGyqk)- enhanced this doc1.0.2a [2009.03.02]- added 'update_url' XML option- added update instruction to doc1.0.2 [2009.02.28]- revised error check logic to ensure cleaner exit- text altered to provide more generic messages- a little more code-tidying1.0.1- added simple error check to prevent sending empty fields- enhanced documentation (this file)- added MIT license to this version1.0- It works![end]
